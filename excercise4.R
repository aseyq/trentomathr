## Excercies

#  1- Create a matrix as follows and call it `M`:
#    8  4   1    
#   -2 -1  0.5
#    2  1   2


# 2- Multiply it with
# - Scalar 32
# - Muliply with another 3 x 2 matrix you define your own 


# 3- Take the inverse of matrix `M`


# 4- Create a 3x3 matrix of ones. Multiply `M` with it and see how the matrix changes.


#5- Create an 3x3 identity matrix. Multiply `M` with it with and see whether M changes.
