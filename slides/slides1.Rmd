# Introduction to R Programming
The most simple way to interact with R is to use it as a calculator. If you go ahead and write `2 + 2` to the console and press enter you will get as the output:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
2 + 2
```
---
## Arithmetic Operators
You can use these **arithmetic operators** to carry out calculations:  
--

 - `+` addition  
```{r}
9 + 2
``` 
--
 - `-` subtraction  
```{r}
9 - 2
``` 
--
 - `*` multiplication  
```{r}
9 * 2
``` 
---
 - `/` division  
```{r}
9 / 2
``` 
--
 - `^` exponent  
```{r}
9 ^ 2
``` 
--
 - `%%` modulus  
```{r}
9 %% 2
``` 
---

## What is an operator?
- A special symbol(s) to do a perform a specific operation.  


--

- Like functions but usually doing the essential bits of a language.  


--
- Usually take values on either side of them and return an output.   


---
- They are really simple. 
  
  - **Arithmetic operators**: calculate things
  
  - **Logical operators**: logical questions/operations
  
  - **Relational operators**: Compare things
---
## Logical Operators
`R` have `TRUE` and `FALSE` values built in. The usual logical rules apply to manipulate and combine logical values.

---

 - `!` negation (NOT)  
 
--

```{r}
! TRUE
``` 

---

 - `&` element-wise AND  
 
--
```{r}
TRUE & TRUE
``` 
--

```{r}
TRUE & FALSE
``` 
--

```{r}
FALSE & FALSE
``` 


---

 - `*` element-wise OR  
```{r}
TRUE | TRUE
```
--
```{r}
TRUE | FALSE
```
--
```{r}
FALSE | FALSE
```

---

## Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to compare the values.
- `==` Equal to
Checks whether two values are equal. (Not to be confused with `=` which might be used for variable assignment. We will talk about that)
```{r}
2 == 9
9 == 2
3 == 3
``` 
---
- `==` Equal to
Checks whether two values are NOT equal. (Mind the single `=`)
```{r}
2 != 9
9 != 2
3 != 3
``` 
---

 - `<` less than  
```{r}
2 < 9
9 < 2
3 < 3
``` 
---
 - `<=` less than or equal to  
```{r}
2 <= 9
9 <= 2
3 <= 3
``` 
---

 - `>` greater than  
```{r}
2 > 9
9 > 2
3 > 3
``` 
---
 - `>` greater than or equal to  
```{r}
2 >= 9
9 >= 2
3 >= 3
```
---
# Variables 
- Usually our problems are generalizable  


--
- We don't write numbers and values to begin with  


--

- We often would like to save the output somewhere and use that value  

---
# Variables
- Variables are **names** to give certain values.  


--
- Variable's name represent what information variable contains  


--
- We use the notation `<-` to assign a value to a variable.  



--
```{r}
ali <- 34
piero  <- 24

agetotal  <- ali + piero
```

--

```{r}
print(agetotal)
```
---

# `print()`

`print()` function is used to write the contents of variables (or other objects) into our console. 

```{r}
print(44)
```
--

```{r}
ali = 11 * 3
print(ali)
```
--
You can print things on the fly
```{r}
print(4 * 10 + 2)
```
---




## Functions 

### Built-in functions
`R` has many built in functions that are helpful for making calculations. Functions have the form:

```
functionname(parameter)
```
---
Some examples:
 - `abs(x)` absolute value  
```{r}
abs(9)
abs(-9)
```
---
 - `sqrt(x)` square root  
```{r}
sqrt(9)
sqrt(10)
```
---

## Creating user-defined functions
You can write your own functions in R. To define your own functions, you need a **name** for the function, a parameter or several parameters, and the **recipe** of what a function does.

--

```{r}
square_root_and_multiply_by_2 <- function(x) {
    return(sqrt(x) * 2)
    }

square_root_and_multiply_by_2(9)
```
---

### Example
```{r}

# Writing our own functions:

P  <- function(x, y) {
    return(x > y)
    }

P(4,3)
P(-1,4)
```

---

```{r}

Q  <- function(x,y,z) {
    return(x^2 + y^2 == z^2)
    }


Q(3,4,5)
Q(2,2,3)

```
