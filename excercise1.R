# Question 1
# Calculate the multiplication of 4, 8 and 12

4 *

# Question 2    
# - Create a variable named `height` with value 4, and another called `width` 10
# - Calculate the area of the rectangle and asign the value to the variable area
# - Check if the value <50
# - Check if the value is equal to 40

# Question 3
# Calculate the distance between the points -4 and 2 using the absolute value (abs) function


# Question 4
# We have two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) in a cartesian system.
# Create a function that calculates their distance and call it distance
# Caluclate the distance of (0,0) and (3,4)
# Calculate the distance of (3,3) and (-1,4)
