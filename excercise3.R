# Excercises 3

# 1 - Put the data of the guesses in a vector. (if you can read from csv file... good. but a simple copy past will suffice)

guesses <- c(
    10, #
    20, # Delete this lines and add the real values
    30, # 
    ... #
)


# 2 - Calculate the mean and save it to `mean_guesses`

mean_guesses


# 3- Draw a histogram from the guesses data

# 4 - Put the real number as a vertical line on the plot.

# 5 - Think about the results. Do you think it was accurate? Were you expecting it? How well did you do?

# 6 - Create the vector of deviations (differences) from the real number. Save it as `accuracies`

# 7 - Now create a vector from the seating row data. save it as `seatings`

# 8 - Plot a graph with `seatings` on the x axis and `accuracies` on the y axis.

# 9 - Interpret the graph. Do you think the people on the front rows did better?
